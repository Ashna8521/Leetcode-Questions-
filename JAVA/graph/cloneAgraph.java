/*
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

OJâ€™s undirected graph serialization:Nodes are labeled uniquely.We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}. The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2. Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2. Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
